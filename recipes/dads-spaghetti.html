        <h1>Dad's Spaghetti</h1>
        <img src="spaghetti.jpg">
        <h4>Nothing shouts "the cook of the house is not cooking tonight" more than dad's spaghetti!</h4>
        <p>A recipe handed down from dad to son, probably since spaghetti and tomato's were invented. A classic that will make
            your girlfriend not let you cook very often. Spaghetti with margarine and tomato juice! If you're lucky you might
            remember to season it with salt and pepper.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Spaghetti noodles (no substitute)</li>
            <li>Tomato juice (again no substitute, it has to be tomato JUICE to give the authentic experience)</li>
            <li>Margarine</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Get a pot and fill it with water and turn the heat up to get the water boiling.</li>
            <li>Add the noodles into the pot. Wait a few minutes for the bottom half to go soft so you can push the other
                half of the noodles into the water. Then let it continue cooking for 5-10 minutes until the noodles are done</li>
            <li>Drain the water from the pot and then get your tub of margarine and put in a scoop or two of margarine
                into the noodle pot with the noodles. Give it a sufficent stir till the butter is mostly melted. Make sure to
                put your pot back onto the hot stove and turn it down a little bit.</li>
            <li>Crack open your can of tomato juice and dump it into that pot of noodles and margarine! Wait for it to get
                to boiling and turn the stove top off. Put some salt and pepper in that pot to make it a bit more flavorful 
                (don't want to overwhelm this dish with flavor though)</li>
            </ol>
